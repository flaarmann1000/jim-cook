# 🥗 Jim Cook  

**Jim Cook** is a personal **recipe organizer app** powered by Generative AI.  
It was born out of frustration:  
- Some recipe sites display ingredients beautifully alongside steps.  
- Others bury you under **family history essays** before showing the actual recipe. 🙃  

With **Jim Cook**, you can **extract recipes from any website** and reformat them exactly how you want — clean, simple, and ready to cook.  
Think of it as your own **personal cooking book**, always organized the way *you* like it.  

Built with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev).
